Hand Gesture Recognition Using Machine Learning
Overview


This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures through machine learning techniques. Hand gesture recognition is a growing field in computer vision that has various applications, including controlling devices through gestures, sign language interpretation, and interactive gaming. This project aims to build a system that can classify different hand gestures captured through images or video frames into predefined categories, such as "thumbs up," "peace," or "stop." Using a dataset of hand gesture images, we apply machine learning models to train the system to identify and classify these gestures accurately.

Methodology

The process begins with collecting and preprocessing the data, where images of hand gestures are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve the model's performance. Feature extraction techniques are employed to highlight key characteristics of the hand shapes and positions. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to train on these features. The goal is to achieve a robust model capable of distinguishing between various gestures under different lighting conditions, backgrounds, and hand orientations.

After training the model, the system is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure its effectiveness. The results of this project could potentially serve as a foundation for developing more advanced gesture-based control systems or integration into human-computer interaction applications. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning the model, increasing the dataset size, and experimenting with real-time gesture recognition systems using video feeds.
